                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's mental well-being. According to the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Task Force report, 
                            "Based on an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) study conducted during the pandemic, 8.7% of the surveyed Singapore population met the criteria for clinical depression, while 9.4% met the criteria for anxiety. 
                            Additionally, 9.3% met the criteria for mild to severe stress." Since the onset of the national Circuit Breaker in 2020, there has been a noticeable rise in the volume of calls received by IMH's Mental Health Helpline. 
                            Generally, mental health has always been a topic that is often overlooked.</p>
                        <p>Maintaining and enhancing mental health solutions after the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, as mental well-being remains a vital component of overall health people can benefit from it. 
                                By continuing to support these solutions, we can assist individuals dealing with diverse stressors and challenges in their lives. 
                                Moreover, the lessons learnt and innovation made in developing mental health responses during the pandemic can be utilised to meet mental health needs in various other situations and crises.</p>
                        <h3>Target Audience</h3>

                        <p>Target audiences are people who might be going through something and the app can assist them to heal themselves, such as childhood trauma, anxiety, stress. 
                        The app consists of features that enables them to seek help with people of similar situations and professional help. While also keeping track of their own feelings and thoughts by journaling down.</p>
