      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted mental well-being, yet mental health remains an often-overlooked issue. 
        A study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) during the pandemic found that 8.7% of Singapore’s surveyed population met the criteria for clinical depression, 9.4% for anxiety, and 9.3% for mild to severe stress. 
        Since the implementation of the national Circuit Breaker in 2020, IMH’s Mental Health Helpline has experienced a surge in call volume, highlighting the growing mental health crisis that continues to be inadequately addressed.

      <p>
        Maintaining and enhancing mental health solutions after the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, as mental well-being remains a vital component of overall health people can benefit from it. 
        By continuing to support these solutions, we can assist individuals dealing with diverse stressors and challenges in their lives. 
        Moreover, the lessons learnt and innovation made in developing mental health responses during the pandemic can be utilised to meet mental health needs in various other situations and crises, highlighting the growing mental health crisis that continues to be inadequately addressed.
