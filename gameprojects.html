                        <p>This project is a AR Application for a Mechanical Keyboard Brand MASH.
                            The app aims to help user choose the keyboard typing sound they like, at the comfort of their home. 
                            Example, if they are buying the keyboards on the websites they probably can’t get a first hand experience of how the keys sound like. 
                            With this AR experience, they can better choose their switches and also see if their keyboards fits their PC set up aesthetic / how big the product looks in real life.

                        <h3>Not so Horror Planet</h3>
                        <p>This game takes place on an abandoned planet where your spaceship crash-landed and broke down. 
                            You wake up to your companion, “Rudy,” informing you that you’ve crashed into an abandoned planet. 
                            The game begins at the crash site, where you explore the wreckage with Rudy and come across a mysterious door. 
                            Upon entering, you find yourself trapped inside a factory with no way out. 
                            To escape, you must search for keys to unlock doors and gather materials to repair your spaceship. 
                            Your journey ends when you successfully fix the ship and make your way back home.
                            As you search for a way out of the factory, you come across two exit signs—one red and one green. 
                            Choosing the wrong path leads to a grim fate; stepping through the red exit dooms you to the dangers of the abandoned planet, forcing you to restart your journey. 
                            However, if you make the right choice and enter the green exit, you successfully escape.
