                        <h3>Not so Horror Planet</h3>
                        <p>This game takes place on an abandoned planet where your spaceship crash-landed and broke down. 
                            You wake up to your companion, “Rudy,” informing you that you’ve crashed into an abandoned planet. 
                            The game begins at the crash site, where you explore the wreckage with Rudy and come across a mysterious door. 
                            Upon entering, you find yourself trapped inside a factory with no way out. 
                            To escape, you must search for keys to unlock doors and gather materials to repair your spaceship. 
                            Your journey ends when you successfully fix the ship and make your way back home.
                            As you search for a way out of the factory, you come across two exit signs—one red and one green. 
                            Choosing the wrong path leads to a grim fate; stepping through the red exit dooms you to the dangers of the abandoned planet, forcing you to restart your journey. 
                            However, if you make the right choice and enter the green exit, you successfully escape.

                            With this AR experience, they can better choose their switches and also see if their keyboards fits their PC set up aesthetic / how big the product looks in real life.

                        <p>This project is a VR game for the human resource department to assess if a candidate is suitable for the high pressure and demanding role of a firefighter. 
                            It is designed to simulate a highly dangerous fire fighting scenario which pushes the candidate to demonstrate their thinking.
                            The game features various challenges such as rescuing the dog, fixing circuits and eliminating unusual fires. 
                            These challenges which can be solved using clues scattered around the house. 
                            Its frequent use of disruptive sounds, such as alarms and fire noises, can be irritating and distract the candidate. 
                            Furthermore, the candidate will be given special instructions by their leader through the walkie talkie.
